                <p id="Description">
                    Celeste is a 2018 platform game designed, directed and written by Maddy Thorson and
                    programmed
                    by Thorson and Noel Berry. It is a fully-fledged version of the 2016 PICO-8 game of the same
                    name, which was made in four days solely by Thorson and Berry during a game jam. Set on a fictional
                    version
                    of Mount Celeste, it follows a young woman named Madeline who attempts to climb the mountain, and
                    must
                    face her inner demons in her quest to reach the summit.

                    Celeste was released worldwide independently on January 25, 2018, on Windows, Nintendo Switch,
                    PlayStation 4, Xbox One, macOS, and Linux, followed by a release on Google's Stadia on July 28,
                    2020. It
                    consists of eight chapters, plus a free downloadable content chapter titled Farewell that acts as an
                    epilogue to the story, released on September 9, 2019.

                    Celeste received critical acclaim upon release, being praised for its story, gameplay, and
                    soundtrack.
                    It won several awards, including the Best Independent Game and Games for Impact awards at The Game
                    Awards 2018, where it was also nominated for Game of the Year. Celeste was also a financial success,
                    selling over a million copies by the end of 2019.
